# AI Assistance Disclosure: Claude Code (Claude Opus 5.5), 2026-10-16. Scope: creates the three
# Kafka topics named in credit-service/docs/implementation-proposal.md (§5.1, §6.1), with the
# author's partition count (1 each). Author review: Reviewed and approved by @phuc
#
# Run by the kafka-init Compose service once the broker is healthy, then it exits.
# Safe to run again: existing topics are left as they are (their partition count is not
# changed; Kafka can only increase it, with kafka-topics.sh --alter).
