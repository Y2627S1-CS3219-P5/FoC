# CS3219 — Software Design and Architecture (AY2627 Sem 1)

## Friend on Campus (FoC)

**Friend on Campus (FoC)** is a peer-to-peer campus errand platform where
students can request items to be collected from stores or facilities on
campus, and other students can fulfil (and deliver) those requests. The
platform runs on a closed credit economy — credits cannot be bought,
withdrawn, or exchanged for money, and only circulate within the platform.

## Repository Structure

This repository follows a **one-service-per-folder** structure: each
microservice (`user-service/`, `supplier-service/`, `order-service/`,
`credit-service/`) lives in its own top-level folder.

```text
.
├── user-service/
├── supplier-service/
├── order-service/
├── credit-service/
├── <n2h-service>/
└── README.md
```

- Any **nice-to-have (N2H)** feature that warrants its own service should
  be added as an **additional folder** at the same level, following the
  same per-service structure.
- Files for agentic coding tools (e.g. agent configs, prompts, skills)
  may be added as needed, but must still **respect the
  one-service-per-folder skeleton** for core implementation.

## Optional local logs

The application can run with an independent local Alloy/Loki/Grafana logging stack.
See [setup, searches and logging-only shutdown/reset](observability/README.md).
Grafana uses loopback port 3300; existing application startup is unchanged.

## AI Use Summary

OpenAI Codex assisted on 2026-11-09 with implementing the author-approved
[Order/Credit CI extension](docs/ci.md) for issue #62: separate Node 22 jobs with
disposable PostgreSQL, locked installation, type-check/build/test commands, and
fail-closed aggregation into `CI / gate`. The author-requested follow-up fixes
native Kafka builds in the User, Order, and Credit Dockerfiles by compiling the
locked addon's bundled source and copying pruned production dependencies into
matching runtime images. The later author-approved extension adds change-aware PR
selection, the complete existing messaging suites, actual authenticated Order/Credit
journeys, strict execution/report checks and sanitized diagnostics before cleanup.
Main pushes and manual runs keep full coverage. No service business logic,
AWS deployment or repository ruleset change is included.
Implementation and verification details are recorded in `ai/usage-log.md`.
The PR #63 changes were reviewed and approved by @ron on 2026-11-09.

OpenAI Codex assisted on 2026-11-10 with the author-approved local centralised
logging plan and its optional configuration, isolated smoke checks and documentation
for issue #66. No application source, root Compose, AWS or CI jobs were changed.
The plan, implementation and disclosures were reviewed and approved by @ron on
2026-11-10. Exact prompts,
scope and verification are recorded in [the usage log](ai/usage-log.md).

OpenAI Codex (GPT-6) assisted on 2026-09-25 and 2026-09-26 with implementing the first three Supplier backend increments from the author-approved specification: NestJS/Drizzle and PostgreSQL foundations; guarded, edit-preserving seed identities; least-privilege Compose setup; real User Service bearer verification; authenticated catalogue reads; request correlation and bundled assets; and administrator-only create/full-update/archive/restore with strict bodies, normalized race-safe duplicate creation rejection, and ETag concurrency. The isolated real-service integration runner now verifies API and SQL mutation state, concurrent stale-write rejection, lifecycle no-ops, repeat-migration/seed preservation, and fail-closed authentication. No Supplier frontend, User Service application changes, Order Service integration, or physical Supplier deletion were included. Project-author review of all three backend increments was completed and approved by @ron. [Strict-JSON disclosure details](supplier-service/AI-DISCLOSURES.md#strict-json-files) retain the pending course-owner exception approval; the exact prompts and key-response summaries are recorded in `ai/usage-log.md`.

Claude Code (Claude Opus 5.5) assisted on 2026-09-26 with implementing the User Service
author's D2 work from the author's own design decisions:
- the React/Vite frontend authentication pages (sign in, create account, logout,
  session-expiry toasts)
- the nginx/Vite reverse-proxy gateway with data-named `/api/v1` paths
- User Service `authenticate`/`requireRole` middleware, `GET`/`PATCH /whoami`, and
  administrator role changes serialised by a database lock
- endpoint documentation

Claude also explained general concepts (JWT, browser storage, CORS vs reverse proxy,
PATCH vs PUT, idempotency, locking) used by the author to make those decisions.
Prohibited phases were avoided: the author chose the routing, storage, endpoint,
status-code and concurrency designs. All output was reviewed and tested by the author.
Prompts and key responses are in `ai/usage-log.md`; per-file attributions are in the
file headers and `frontend/AI-DISCLOSURES.md`.

Claude Code (Claude Opus 5.5) assisted on 2026-10-16 with implementing the Order Service core
from the author's approved plan: the errand lifecycle and its PostgreSQL schema, atomic state
transitions with an outbox, the deadline sweeper, Credit reply handling, a stub Credit Service,
the HTTP API with relationship-based authorization, the container, Compose services, gateway
routes and a demo script. The author made the design decisions listed in the plan's design
calls; Claude drafted them as proposals. Project-author review of the implementation is
pending. Prompts and key responses are in `ai/usage-log.md`; per-file attributions are in the
file headers.

OpenAI Codex (GPT-6) assisted on 2026-11-09 with issue #64 by updating the Supplier
browser test to check the existing "Request an errand from here" link and its exact
Supplier preselection URL after PR #59 removed the old placeholder. The existing
member and administrator browser journeys both passed locally. Author review is
pending; the exact prompt and verification results are in `ai/usage-log.md`.

OpenAI Codex (GPT-6) assisted on 2026-11-09 with the requested authenticated Credit
transaction history endpoint from issue #58: own-user reads, optional date bounds,
pagination, live User Service verification, independent Kafka startup, gateway and
Compose wiring, and focused HTTP/database tests. Author review: Reviewed and approved by @phuc.
Exact prompts and verification evidence are recorded in `ai/usage-log.md`;
JSON dependency attribution is in `credit-service/AI-DISCLOSURES.md`.

OpenAI Codex (GPT-6) assisted on 2026-11-09 with the Credit transaction frontend
in issue #65: authenticated history, Singapore date filters, pagination, responsive
transaction cards, failure recovery, tests and local preview startup. Author review: Reviewed and approved by @phuc. Exact prompts and verification are recorded in `ai/usage-log.md`.

The issue #65 Credit view now also displays live available and reserved balances
from the existing balance query through authenticated GET /api/v1/me/credit.
OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 2026-11-09; Author review: Reviewed and approved by @phuc. Verification and the exact
request are recorded in `ai/usage-log.md`.
